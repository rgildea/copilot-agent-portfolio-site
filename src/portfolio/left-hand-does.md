description: "I've been playing with this Boston-based indie rock band since
  2008. Founded in the early '00s by siblings Jean and Luke Sullivan, we
  developed a very organic group improvisation and songwriting process. We
  recorded multiple albums including 'Coast Is Clear' (2020), 'Just A Nerd'
  (2019) and 'Mama Chaos: Legend Language' (2017)."
