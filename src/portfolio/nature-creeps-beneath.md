description: Along with long-time collaborators John Barber & Alex Major (Ellis
  Ashbrook), I embarked on this musical project mixing our love of freewheeling
  improvisations with deep emotional landscapes and indie singer-songwriter
  vibes. I provided guitars, keys/synths, mixing and additional production work
  for our album entitled 'Ellis Ashbrook' and most recently 2023's 'Outfinite'.
