description: I use Celemony Melodyne Studio and Antares Autotune Advanced to
  tune vocals. I'm an expert with both tools, so I can get any result you want,
  whether you are looking for a transparent result, hyper-realistic pop tuning,
  creative use of tuning, or some combination of those approaches.
