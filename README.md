# Audio Editing Portfolio

This is a professional portfolio website showcasing my audio editing, mixing, and production work.

## How to View

1. Open `index.html` in any web browser to view the site.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file with site content and structure
- `styles.css`: Stylesheet for the site's design and layout
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for interactivity and animations
- `images/`: Folder containing all project images
  - `hero-background.jpg`: Main hero section background image
  - `occo.jpg`: OCCO project image
  - `eons-past.jpg`: EONS PAST project image
  - `hornz.jpg`: HORNZ project image

  - `jerzee.jpg`: JERZEE project image
  - `podcast.jpg`: Podcast series project image

## Adding Your Images

To add your own images to the portfolio:

1. **Prepare your images**:
   - Resize your images to appropriate dimensions:
     - Hero background: 1920×1080px
     - Portfolio items: 800×600px or 1200×800px
   - Optimize images for web (compress to reduce file size)
   - Save in JPG or PNG format

2. **Replace the placeholder files**:
   - Place your project images in the `images/` folder
   - Use the same filenames to maintain the CSS connections:
     - `occo.jpg`
     - `eons-past.jpg`
     - `hornz.jpg`
     - `post-work-society.jpg`
     - `jerzee.jpg`
     - `podcast.jpg`
     - `hero-background.jpg`

## Customization

- Edit the HTML content in `index.html` to update text and information
- Modify colors and styling in `styles.css` (look for the `:root` section with CSS variables)
- Adjust interactions and animations in `script.js`

## Browser Compatibility

This site is designed to work with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
