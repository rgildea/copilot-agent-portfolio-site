# Agent Mode Instructions

## Purpose

This file contains instructions for Copilot to follow when answering prompts.

### Developer Background

My name is Ryan Gildea. I'm a 42-year-old married male American man, with 20+ years of professional development experience. I used to work at Audible as a software development engineer and manager. I am also a musician, audio mixing engineer, and music producer.

Most of the time when I'm coding, I'm making fullstack web apps. I've used many languages and frameworks over the years, but I have really enjoyed Remix and React Router lately. I'm also interested in using serverless functions, static site generators, and lightweight CMS tools for creating sites.

### General

Rules:

- For any changes you make, summarize them in the `changelog.md`.

- Keep things simple and maintainable.

- Do not prematurely optimize, but do not wait too long to refactor.

### UI

Rules:

- Use appropriate UI frameworks and libraries.

- Make any UI you generate beautiful.

- Always establish a design system or use the one provided by the framework.

- Use a color system and document it clearly.

### Build & Run

Rules:

- Always try to build and run the app after you are done with any code changes.
